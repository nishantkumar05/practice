Questions... 

A) BIG-O
1- Asymptotic time and space complexity. What is asymptotic?
2- Amortized time complexity. What is amortized? 
  a) Give an example of popular aglorithm that has amortized time compelxity with O(1)
  b) Calculate time complexity of above algorithm O(1)
3- List common time complexity (and their names) Big-O notations in increasing order. (hint: o(1), O(log n)..)
4- Time complexity of String concatenation 

B) 
1- List type of DS you know and how are they implemented e.g. priority queues using trees or arrays etc
2- What does it mean by compiler/platform/machine dependent aspect of language? eg. short is gauranteed to be shorter than long int but size is platform dependent?
3- How to calcualte median?
4- List compiler steps. Basic and detailed
5- Binary programs memory anatomy?
6- String fundamentals. What are string types, how are they stored in memory. What is encoding? What are some standards and encoding.
